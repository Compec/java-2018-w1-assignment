# Java Training 2018 - Week 1

## Download the project

### If you are comfortable with Git (Windows)

In Windows, go to the folder in which you would like to download this repository, click on the address bar at the top 
and type `cmd.exe`. This will open up the command line terminal, where you will enter the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Compec/java-2018-w1
```

Launch `IntelliJ IDEA` and open the project by selecting the folder where you downloaded the project.

### If you are not comfortable with Git (Windows)

Simply press on the green button `Clone or Download` in top-right corner of this page and press `Download ZIP`.
Download the ZIP file then extract it with your zip program (Winrar, 7zip ...)

#### For other operating systems

 I do not have a mac/linux machine so I prefer not to give instructions :) The steps should be very similar though.

## Assignment

Write a Java program to print `Hello` on screen and then print *your* name on a separate line.

#### Expected Output
```
Hello
Mehdi Saffar
```

#### Improvements

A) Make the program ask the user for its name and display it

Example:
```
Hello
What is your name? __Mehdi Saffar__
Hello Mehdi Saffar
```

B) Make the program ask the user for its age, calculate its birth year from the age and display it
- Try having a function called `calculateBirthYear` that takes the current year and the age of the user as input and returns the birth year


Example:
```
Hello
What is your name? Mehdi Saffar
Hello Mehdi Saffar, what is your age? 22
You are born in 1996
```

C) Ask the user for its GPA and display a message according to his GPA

- There must be at least 3 different messages
- We haven't learned how to input decimal numbers from the console. Try looking in google how to do that. Example search: `java scanner console double`

Example:
```
Hello
What is your name? Mehdi Saffar
Hello Mehdi Saffar, what is your age? 22
You are born in 1996
What is your GPA? 3.4
Nice GPA buddy ;)
```
